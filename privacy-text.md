## Privacy policy

**Hosting**  
Our hoster collects the following data transmitted by your browser in so-called log files:

IP address, the address of the previously visited website (referer request header), date and time of the request, time zone difference to Greenwich Mean Time, content of the request, HTTP status code, amount of data transferred, website from which the request came and information about the browser and operating system.

This is necessary to display our website and to ensure stability and security. This corresponds to our legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f DSGVO.

There is no tracking and we do not have direct access to this data, but only receive an anonymized statistical summary. This includes the address of the previously visited page, the frequency of each page viewed and the number of unique visitors. We do not combine this data with other data.

We use the following hoster to make our website available:

GitHub Inc.  
88 Colin P Kelly Jr St  
San Francisco, CA 94107  
United States

This is the recipient of your personal data. This corresponds to our legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. f DSGVO, not having to maintain a server on our premises ourselves. Server location is USA.

For more information on objection and removal options vis-Ã -vis GitHub, please visit: [https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement#github-pages](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement#github-pages).

You have the right to object to the processing. Whether the objection is successful is to be determined in the context of a balancing of interests.

The data will be deleted as soon as the purpose of the processing ceases to apply.

The processing of the data provided under this section is not required by law or contract. The functionality of the website is not guaranteed without the processing.

GitHub has implemented compliance measures for international data transfers. These apply to all global activities where GitHub processes personal data of individuals in the EU. These measures are based on the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs). For more information, please visit: [https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/site-policy/github-data-protection-addendum#attachment-1--the-standard-contractual-clauses-processors](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/site-policy/github-data-protection-addendum#attachment-1--the-standard-contractual-clauses-processors)

## Legal notice

In principle, a contract processing agreement must be concluded with the hoster. The Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision has made an exception for the hosting of purely static websites. In the event that the website is used for self-expression, e.g. by associations or small businesses, no personal data flows to the operator and no tracking takes place, there is no commissioned processing. It goes on to say that "the fact that IP addresses, i.e. personal data, must inevitably be processed even when hosting static websites does not lead to the assumption of commissioned processing. That would not be appropriate. Rather, the (short-term) IP address storage is still attributable to the telecommunications access provision of the website hoster pursuant to the TKG and primarily serves security purposes of the hoster." ([https://www.lda.bayern.de/media/veroeffentlichungen/FAQ_Hosting_keine_Auftragsverarbeitung.pdf](https://www.lda.bayern.de/media/veroeffentlichungen/FAQ_Hosting_keine_Auftragsverarbeitung.pdf) in German) We assume that this exception applies to GitHub Pages.
