1. Access Data and Hosting

You can visit our website without providing any personal information. Every time you visit our website, the web server automatically saves a so-called server logfile which contains data like the name of the requested file, your IP address, date and time of the request, the amount of data transmitted and the requesting provider (all together “access data”), and documents your visit.

The access data is evaluated exclusively for the purpose of ensuring the error-free functioning of the site and of improving our services. This is necessary for the protection of our legitimate interests in the proper presentation of our offer which are overriding in the process of balancing of interests pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. All access data will be deleted no later than seven days after the end of your visit to the site.

We use the following host to make our website available:

GitHub Inc.  
88 Colin P Kelly Jr St  
San Francisco, CA 94107  
United States

This is the recipient of your personal data. This corresponds to our legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. f DSGVO: not having to maintain a server on our premises ourselves. The server location is in the USA.

The data will be deleted as soon as the purpose of the processing ceases to apply.

The processing of the data provided under this section is not required by law or contract. The functionality of the website is not guaranteed without the processing.

GitHub has implemented compliance measures for international data transfers. These apply to all global activities where GitHub processes personal data of individuals in the EU. These measures are based on the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs). For more information, please visit this [site](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/site-policy/github-data-protection-addendum#attachment-1--the-standard-contractual-clauses-processors).

2. Third Country Transfer

In this section, we inform you about the processing of personal data related to you in third countries for which there is no adequacy decision adopted by the EU Commission.

Trusted Shops uses a variety of service providers. Many of them use servers in third countries, i.e. outside the EU or the EEA. This also includes the USA. The transfer of personal data associated with this must be carried out in accordance with Art. 44 et seq. GDPR. In July 2020, the ECJ ruled that the Privacy-Shield Agreement between the EU and the USA can no longer be used to transfer personal data to the USA. This means that the sectoral adequacy decision of the EU Commission has been revoked.

However, the Privacy Shield as such and the associated self-certification will remain in place. This means that US companies that have self-certified and registered with the U.S. Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration (see overview [here](https://www.privacyshield.gov/list)) will continue to act in compliance with the Privacy Shield rules, which will ensure a good level of data protection to the greatest extent possible.

In addition, Trusted Shops obliges service providers who process personal data in a third country to comply with the [standard data protection clauses](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32010D0087) issued by the EU Commission which are still valid. Where possible, we also agree on additional guarantees to ensure that adequate data protection is guaranteed in the USA or other third countries.

Despite all contractual and technical measures, it is possible that the level of data protection in the third country may not be the same as in the EU. In such cases we will ask you, if necessary, as part of cookie consent, in (contact) forms or in the case of other registrations and notifications, for your consent under Art. 49 (1) (a) GDPR to transfer your personal data to a third country. This applies in particular to the transfer of data to the USA. In the USA, authorities and intelligence services may have the right and the capability to access your personal data without our knowledge as the data exporter or yours as the data subject, and without you having sufficient legal means to prevent or take action against such access.

3. Contact possibilities and your rights

As a data subject, you have the following rights:

-   pursuant to Art. 15 GDPR, you have the right to request information about your personal data processed by us to the extent described therein;
    
-   pursuant to Art. 16 GDPR, you have the right to demand the immediate rectification of inaccurate or incomplete personal data stored by us;
    
-   pursuant to Art. 17 GDPR, the right to request the erasure of your personal data stored with us, unless further processing is necessary:  
    - in order to exercise the right of freedom of expression and information;  
    - for the compliance with a legal obligation;  
    - for reasons of public interest, or  
    - for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims;
    
-   pursuant to Art. 18 GDPR, the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data, insofar as:  
    - you are contesting the accuracy of the data;  
    - the processing is unlawful, but you oppose the erasure of the data;  
    - we no longer need the data for the purposes of processing, but you require it for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, or  
    - you have objected to the processing pursuant to Art. 21 GDPR;
    

-   pursuant to Art. 20 GDPR, you have the right to receive your personal data that you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, or to request its transfer to another controller;
    
-   pursuant to Art. 77 GDPR, the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority . You can also contact the supervisory authority at your habitual residence or place of work, or at the place of our company headquarters.
    

If you have any questions regarding the collection, processing or use of your personal data, information on personal data concerning you, the restriction of data processing, the rectification or erasure of data, the revocation of given consent, or the objection to a specific use of data, please contact our company’s data protection officer.

Right of objection

Insofar as we process personal data in any of the above described manners in order to protect our legitimate interests that are overriding in the process of balancing of interests, you can object to this processing with effect for the future. If the data is processed for direct marketing purposes, you can exercise this right at any time as described above. If the processing takes place for other purposes, you are only entitled to a right of objection as far as it is justified for reasons arising from your particular situation.

After exercising your right of objection, we will not process your personal data for these purposes anymore, unless we can provide and prove compelling legitimate reasons that the processing must proceed, which outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms, or if the processing serves to establish, exercise or defend legal claims. This does not apply if the processing has taken place for direct marketing purposes. In this case, we will cease to process your personal data for this purpose.
